# Project Name: Keanan

## Tagline
Multi-Task Transformer for Language, Image, and Speech Analysis

## Overview
In today's digital age, the need for efficient and effective tools to analyze large volumes of data is growing rapidly. The Keanan project aims to address this challenge by developing a Multi-Task Transformer for Language, Image, and Speech Analysis. This versatile tool combines the power of five open-source transformer models: BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, T5, and ELECTRA, along with the Vision-Transformer (ViT) model for image analysis and the Speech-Transformer model for speech recognition.
