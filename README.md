# Project Name: Keanan

## Tagline
Multi-Task Transformer for Language, Image, and Speech Analysis

## Overview
In today's digital age, the need for efficient and effective tools to analyze large volumes of data is growing rapidly. The Keanan project aims to address this challenge by developing a Multi-Task Transformer for Language, Image, and Speech Analysis. This versatile tool combines the power of five open-source transformer models: BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, T5, and ELECTRA, along with the Vision-Transformer (ViT) model for image analysis and the Speech-Transformer model for speech recognition.

## Installation
To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/samuelkchris/keanan.git

## Usage
Once the web application is running, you can use it to analyze text, images, and speech. Here's how:

Input Text: Enter the text you want to analyze in the provided input box.

Upload Image: If you want to analyze an image, click on the "Upload Image" button and select an image file from your device.

Record Speech: To analyze speech, click on the "Record Speech" button and start speaking. Click the button again to stop recording.

Click the "Analyze" button to initiate the analysis process.

View Analysis Results: The results of the analysis will be displayed on the web application interface, providing insights and information based on the input provided.
